#### Description:
JOURNAL basically has six files apart from the virtual environment file, instance and session that are generated with a single use alone. The flask-session folder contains session files and stores each session for users, the instance folder contain the journal.db file that serves as the database, the venv folder contains the scripts and other dependencies and is the name of the virtual environment, while the requirement folder contains the requirements text file that stores all the installation needed for the app to run, the static folde contains files like the css and js files used for styling and enabling some functionality for the web-app, the templates folder contains all the templates that will be rendered per each route the user visits. lastly, the app.py contains the code written for the app to be created and run. 

This app (JOURNAL) was designed to help users document their day to day activities online and spare them the effort of having to carry heavy journals or diaries. The text area in the index.html of this app consists of cool functionalities that can be used on the go, like, bold, italicize, underline, paint and much more. I chose the text area from tiny.cloud because of its formatting features. JOURNAL helps with security as only those who know the password can have access to it unlike a diary or a journal that can be stolen hence the need for my adding a one time only pssword to be chosen. It can't be stolen, it is fire proof and can only be destroyed by the owner or when we have the internet apocalypse or amargeddon! "Journal" is a cool app as it is simple to use and navigate consisting of the type page and the history page where all previous entries can be seen with the most recent by date on the top. To use the app, register with a unique username, password and email. On successful registration, you are good to go. You can now write down your thoughts, one stroke at a time.
