The text area of this app consists of cool functionalities that can be used on the go, like, bold, italicize, underline, paint and much more. It also helps with security as only those who know the password can have access to it unlike a diary or a journal that can be stolen. It can't be stolen, it is fire proof and can only be destroyed by the owner or when we have the internet apocalypse or amargeddon!
